# ADR: Scope

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-02-19

## Context
The MVP must prioritize trust and same-venue social discovery before expanding to full messaging experiences.

## Decision
Prioritize check-in trust, same-venue discovery, moderation, and interactions; keep chat as a placeholder route until dedicated chat phase delivery.

## Consequences
- Team focuses effort on core venue presence and matching loops.
- `chat` route can exist in navigation without full messaging logic.
- Messaging requirements are tracked as a separate future phase.

## Evidence
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/phases/14-cleanup-navigation-restructure/14-02-SUMMARY.md`
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`
