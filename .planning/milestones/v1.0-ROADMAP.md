# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Delivered the v1 trust loop: trustworthy proximity-based check-in, same-venue discovery with visibility controls, safety/moderation enforcement, and offer/notification value delivery. The phase structure followed dependency order — check-in trust first, then discoverability, then safety, then value features.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Check-in Trust Core

**Goal**: Users can create and maintain a valid check-in state that reflects real venue proximity and expires reliably.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CHKN-01, CHKN-02, CHKN-03
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can check in only when they are physically within the configured venue distance threshold.
  2. User receives a specific denial message when check-in is refused (distance, stale location, cooldown, or suspicious movement).
  3. User can have only one active check-in at a time and prior/expired presence is no longer treated as active.
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Server-side check-in trust RPC (proximity, freshness, cooldown) + auto-expiry cron
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Client integration with server trust boundary + pt-BR denial messages

### Phase 2: Same-Venue Discovery

**Goal**: Users can reliably discover who is currently at the same venue, with clear recency and visibility control.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DISC-01, DISC-02
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can open a venue roster that shows people currently checked in at that venue.
  2. User can see freshness/recency indicators that distinguish current presence from stale presence.
  3. User can set visibility mode per check-in (public at venue, friends-only, or private).
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Server-side visibility column + updated RPCs (recency data + visibility filter)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Client visibility selector in check-in modal + recency indicators on discover screen

### Phase 3: Safety and Moderation Enforcement

**Goal**: Users can protect themselves in discovery contexts and blocked relationships are enforced in visible surfaces.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: SAFE-01, SAFE-02, DISC-03
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can block another user directly from profile and venue roster surfaces.
  2. User can submit a report with predefined reason and optional note from discovery/profile contexts.
  3. User never sees blocked users in discovery or venue roster views after block state applies.
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Backend: missing blocked_id index, reports UNIQUE constraint, TypeScript types
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: moderation service, block store, block/report UI on profile + discover screens

### Phase 4: Offer and Notification Controls

**Goal**: Users can access venue offer value only from valid presence and control which notification categories they receive.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: OFFR-01, OFFR-02, NOTF-01, NOTF-02
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can unlock drink offers only when they have a valid active check-in.
  2. User can see clear offer state transitions (available, unlocked, expired, unavailable).
  3. User can configure social and offer notification preferences independently.
  4. User receives notifications only for categories currently enabled in preferences.
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Server-enforced drink offer gating on active check-in + clear offer state UI
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Notification preferences schema, service, store, and settings UI toggles

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for trust boundary (check-in, offers, notifications) — bypasses RLS, validates auth.uid() internally
- Server-authoritative check-in — removed all client-side distance gating, server enforces 100m via ST_DWithin
- Visibility as TEXT + CHECK constraint (not ENUM) for simpler migration
- Set<string> in Zustand for O(1) blocked-user lookups on client
- Opt-out notification model — all categories enabled by default
- pt-BR denial/error messages mapped client-side from server error codes

**Issues Resolved:**
- Client-side distance gating replaced with server-authoritative trust boundary
- Block filtering layered (server RPC + client-side optimistic) for consistent UX after new blocks
- Drink offer sender identity moved from client params to server auth.uid()

**Issues Deferred:**
- friends_only visibility filtering (column is schema-ready, filtering deferred)
- Realtime and reconciliation tuning for discovery scale
- Fraud threshold calibration needs production telemetry

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- No automated tests (codebase mapping surfaced this pre-milestone)
- friends_only column exists but isn't filtered in get_users_at_venue
