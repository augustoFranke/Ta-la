## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Preserve venues cache on logout | Venue list is not user-specific; clearing forces expensive re-fetch on next login | Phase 14 |
| Use .getState() for store calls in signOut | signOut is a regular async function, not a React component | Phase 14 |
| Google Places API (New) | Pivot from Foursquare for better data quality in Brazil; optimized for cost | v2.0 planning |
| Chat in MVP | Core to hookup use case — match without chat is dead end | v2.0 planning |
| 4-tab nav | Dedicated Chat tab improves engagement and accessibility | v2.0 planning |
| Remove venue detail page | Reduces friction to check-in; venue info is secondary to people | v2.0 planning |
| 10m check-in radius | Tighter proximity = higher trust that person is actually there | v2.0 planning |
| Haversine Formula | Avoid Google Distance Matrix API costs by calculating distance locally | v2.0 planning |
| 3 interaction types | Options without friction; wave/like are lower commitment than drink | v2.0 planning |

Key patterns established (from v1.x):
- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for trust boundaries (check-in, offers, notifications)
- Server-authoritative check-in — no client-side distance gating
- TEXT + CHECK constraint for enums (not Postgres ENUM type)
- Set<string> in Zustand for O(1) blocked-user lookups
- Opt-out notification model (all enabled by default)
- pt-BR error messages mapped client-side from server codes
- Deep link hydration: useLocalSearchParams + Supabase fetch when store is empty
- Google Places API (New) with Field Masking and aggressive caching
- __DEV__ guard pattern for dev-only store actions (no-ops in production)
- [Phase 14]: Suppress discover.tsx with href: null — Expo Router auto-discovers all files; href: null hides tab without deleting file

### Technical Debt

- 3 dead code functions to remove (Phase 14)
- Stores not reset on logout (Phase 14)
- 25+ hardcoded colors not using theme tokens (tracked, not blocking)
- Database types incomplete (only `users` modeled in `src/types/database.ts`)

### Blockers

None.

### Open Questions

None.

## Session Continuity

### What Just Happened

1. Phase 14 Plan 02 complete — 4-tab navigation restructure
2. Created app/(tabs)/chat.tsx — "Em breve" placeholder with lock icon
3. Removed Explorar tab from _layout.tsx and deleted explore.tsx
4. Suppressed discover.tsx with href: null (Expo Router was auto-registering it as 5th tab)

### What's Next

Continue Phase 14: Cleanup & Navigation Restructure
- Plan 03: (next plan)
